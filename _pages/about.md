I am a Ph.D. researcher in robotics and autonomous systems at _Nanyang Technological University_, working at the intersection of trustworthy AI, autonomous driving, and human–machine collaboration. My research focuses on building intelligent systems that remain safe, robust, and cooperative under uncertainty, adversarial conditions, and real-world constraints.

My doctoral research focuses on trustworthy self-driving systems, including adversarial scene generation, online monitoring, and decision-making under uncertainty. Rather than optimizing average performance, I focus on exposing, monitoring, and managing failure modes.

Before my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at _Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment_, developing high-frequency algorithms (240kHz) for 5G systems. This experience shaped my engineering approach: AI systems must be deployable, resource-aware, and verifiable.

In parallel, I have worked on soft robotics, exoskeletons, and human–robot interfaces, which strongly influence how I view AI as an embodied, interactive system rather than a standalone model.

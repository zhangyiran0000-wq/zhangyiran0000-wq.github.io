**Overview.**  
Although illustrated here using **autonomous driving as a representative safety-critical domain**, the framework is intended to be **general** and has informed my work in human–machine interaction and embodied robotic systems.
 
## Demo 1 — Natural Scene Generation (2022)

  <!-- Description (RIGHT) -->
  <div class="demo-text">
  **Summary:** The bayesian game-theoretic approach is used to generate natural scenes for testing. The scene genration algorithm is validated using the Turing test, which is shown above.

## Demo 2 — Adversarial Scene Generation (2025, the vidoe clip is to be uploaded.)

  **Summary:** Targeting on the potention defect of the AI approach, we design adversarial scene generation algorithm to stress test the algorithm. Our priority is testing efficiency.
